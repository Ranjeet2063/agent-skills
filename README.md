## injective-frontend-wallet

Build, review, or debug browser frontends that sign and broadcast Injective
transactions with Keplr, Leap, MetaMask, CosmJS, @injectivelabs/sdk-ts, or
CosmWasm execute messages.

Install via NPM:

```bash
npx skills add InjectiveLabs/agent-skills --skill injective-frontend-wallet

## injective-trading-frontend-ux

Build, review, or debug Injective trading frontend UX for RFQ, orderbook,
AuthZ/autosign, wallet-connected trading, USDC balances, trade buttons, search,
and user-facing error states.

Install via NPM:

```bash
npx skills add InjectiveLabs/agent-skills --skill injective-trading-frontend-ux
```

See [`skills/injective-trading-frontend-ux`](./skills/injective-trading-frontend-ux/README.md)

## injective-mcp-servers

Set up and use MCP servers that are important for Injective.

Install via NPM:

```bash
npx skills add InjectiveLabs/agent-skills --skill injective-mcp-servers
```

See [`skills/injective-mcp-servers`](./skills/injective-mcp-servers/README.md)

## injective-trading-tokens

Look up metadata for any Injective token or denom. Resolves native tokens (INJ), Peggy ERC-20 bridged tokens (USDT, USDC, WETH), IBC assets (ATOM, OSMO), TokenFactory tokens, and EVM ERC-20s to their human-readable symbol, decimals, and type. Also supports sending tokens between addresses and depositing/withdrawing from trading subaccounts. Requires the Injective MCP server to be connected.

Install via NPM:

```bash
npx skills add InjectiveLabs/agent-skills --skill injective-trading-tokens
```

See [`injective-trading-tokens`](./skills/injective-trading-tokens/README.md)
for more information.

## injective-trading-autosign

Set up AuthZ delegation on Injective for session-based auto-trading.
Grants a scoped, time-limited permission to an ephemeral key so the AI can place and close perpetual trades
without a wallet popup or password prompt for every order.
Use authz_grant to enable, authz_revoke to disable.
Requires the Injective MCP server to be connected.

Install via NPM:

```bash
npx skills add InjectiveLabs/agent-skills --skill injective-trading-autosign
```

See [`injective-trading-autosign`](./skills/injective-trading-autosign/README.md)
for more information.

## injective-trading-bridge

Bridge tokens to and from Injective using deBridge DLN (fast, cross-chain) or Peggy (Ethereum canonical bridge).
Supports inbound bridges from Arbitrum, Ethereum, Base, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche, and Optimism into Injective,
and outbound bridges from Injective to any deBridge-supported chain.
Get quotes before executing.
Requires the Injective MCP server to be connected.

Install via NPM:

```bash
npx skills add InjectiveLabs/agent-skills --skill injective-trading-bridge
```

See [`injective-trading-bridge`](./skills/injective-trading-bridge/README.md)
for more information.

## injective-trading-chain-analysis

Analyze Injective chain-level code and protocol specs.
Read Go source from injective-core, explain exchange module features
(position offsetting, liquidations, margin tiers, funding), and identify spec gaps.
Use when discussing chain mechanics, reviewing Injective Go code, or explaining protocol behavior.

Install via NPM:

```bash
npx skills add InjectiveLabs/agent-skills --skill injective-trading-chain-analysis
```

and retrieve current spread and funding information.
Requires the Injective MCP server to be connected.

Install via NPM:

```bash
npx skills add InjectiveLabs/agent-skills --skill injective-trading-market-data
```
